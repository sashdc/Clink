## Overview

Clink is a webapp that uses the https://www.thecocktaildb.com/ API to let users generate recipe cards for cocktails and mocktails based on their input. This can be random, from an alphabetical list, or based on ingredients. The site is optimized to be fully responsive to all screens sizes.

## How to Use Clink:

On landing, the user is given the choice of Random, A-Z, or Bar. Once in the latter two links they are given choices of alphabet or ingredients which then generates a list of pertinent cocktails with images that can be chosen to generate the recipe card.

## Technologies Used:

- React
- React-Router-Dom

- Font-Awesome
- Bootstrap
- 3rd Party API
